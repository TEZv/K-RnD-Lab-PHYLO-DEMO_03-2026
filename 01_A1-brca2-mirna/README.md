## 🔬 Key Finding
> hsa-miR-148a-3p is the top downregulated miRNA in BRCA2-mutant breast cancer (log2FC=−0.70, padj=0.013), targeting DNMT1 and AKT2, suggesting epigenetic reprogramming as a therapeutic axis.

**Model performance:** 25 significant DE miRNAs identified (padj ≤ 0.05, |log2FC| ≥ 0.3) | **Dataset:** N = 300 (13 BRCA2-mutant, 287 wildtype) — ⚠️ SIMULATED DATA

## 📊 Results Summary
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total miRNAs profiled | 300 |
| Significant DE miRNAs (padj ≤ 0.05) | 25 |
| Downregulated | 17 |
| Upregulated | 8 |
| Top candidate | hsa-miR-148a-3p |
| Top candidate log2FC | −0.70 |
| Top candidate padj | 0.013 |
| Core overlap (3 subtypes) | 12 miRNAs |
| Top KEGG pathway | Pathways in cancer (padj=9.0×10⁻⁶⁰) |
| BRCA2-mutant samples | 13 |
| Wildtype samples | 287 |

> ⚠️ All quantitative results are based on **SIMULATED DATA** anchored to published TCGA BRCA statistics. The three anchor miRNAs (hsa-miR-148a-3p, hsa-miR-30e-5p, hsa-miR-551b-3p) use exact reported values; all other values are computationally generated for illustration purposes.

```

## ⚠️ Limitations
1. **Simulated data**: All expression values and DE statistics (except the 3 anchor miRNAs) are computationally generated. Results should not be interpreted as real experimental findings.
2. **Small BRCA2-mutant cohort**: N=13 BRCA2-mutant samples provides limited statistical power; real TCGA analysis would require careful covariate adjustment.
3. **No multi-variate correction**: Tumor stage, grade, ER/PR/HER2 status, and age were not modeled as covariates in this illustrative analysis.
4. **miRNA–target interactions**: Network edges are drawn from literature databases (miRTarBase, TargetScan) and represent predicted/validated interactions, not causal relationships demonstrated in BRCA2-mutant cells specifically.
5. **KEGG enrichment**: Pathway analysis was performed on curated target gene lists, not experimentally validated downstream effects.
6. **No validation cohort**: Results require independent validation in GEO datasets (e.g., GSE37405, GSE68085) and functional assays.
